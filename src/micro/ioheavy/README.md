# Micro Benchmark Workload - IOHeavy
## Description
This workload is designed to evaluate the IO performance by invoking a contract that performs
a large number of writes and reads to contract's states.

In this workload, we used 20-byte keys and 100-byte values for the key-value pairs.

To see more details, please refer to the README file in each individual directory for each system.
